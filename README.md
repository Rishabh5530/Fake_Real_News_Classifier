# Fake_Real_News_Classifier
This project was done as a part of the Advanced Data Science Capstone project which is a part of a specialization on coursera by IBM.

The notebook is a little raw.
Data has been taken from 4 sources and saved in to dataframes. These are then processed and cleaned as per the requirement. Various models have then been applied to get the best result for classification of news. A deep learning approach using neural networks has also been attempted as part of my learning experience.

A video presentation of the project can be found at below link.

PS: Forgive the video quality as it was my first with a video submission.
